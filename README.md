# Dante Log Converter

These convenience scripts help to analyze Dante Controller logs.

## Usage

### Concatenate log files

1. Place all the desired log files in a dedicated directory
2. Copy the `concatenate-log-files.bat` script along with them
3. Execute the script by double-clicking it

After execution an `OUTPUT.log` file is created.

### Convert a log file into CSV

There are two ways of doing it:

OR

* Execute in command prompt: `convert-dante-log-to-csv.py <log file>`
